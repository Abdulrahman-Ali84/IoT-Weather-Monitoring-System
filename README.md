IoT Smart Weather Monitoring and Alerting System

Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) Weather Monitoring System using Arduino is a cost-effective and efficient solution designed to measure and monitor environmental parameters in real-time. This project leverages various sensors and Arduino microcontroller technology to collect data on temperature, humidity, rainfall, and air quality. The data is displayed on an LCD, and alerts are provided via a buzzer if thresholds are exceeded. This system can be further enhanced with IoT capabilities, enabling remote monitoring and data analysis for smart agriculture, disaster management, and home automation.

Objectives
1.	Real-time Monitoring: Measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and gas concentration.
2.	Data Visualization: Display sensor readings on an LCD for easy accessibility.
3.	Alert Mechanism: Trigger buzzer alerts when thresholds for rain or gas concentration are exceeded.
4.	Expandability: Offer a scalable platform for adding IoT features like wireless data transmission and cloud integration.
5.	Cost Efficiency: Provide a low-cost, user-friendly solution for weather monitoring.
